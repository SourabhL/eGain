## Introduction

This repository contains the React Redux front-end for the InferTrade tool. You can run the tool with partial features on its own, but you need to also deploy the [infertrade-backend](https://github.com/ProjectOPTimize/infertrade-backend/blob/dev/README.md) node server for full functionality.

The main production site is hosted here: http://egainreact.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ , and has the following main features:

1. Get Product Details by Product Name
2. View Offers from different Websites
3. Get offer from any particular website
